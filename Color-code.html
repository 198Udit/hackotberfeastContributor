In HTML, color is defined using CSS properties. The property you use for a particular situation will depend on what it is you're applying color to. For example, two popular CSS properties for defining color are the color property (for applying foreground color to the text) and background-color property (for applying color to an element's background).

When it comes to specifying an actual color, that's where things get a little interesting. There are many ways of specifying color in HTML. Most web developers choose their preferred method and stick with that. Having said that, you should be aware of the various methods for specifying a color value, because, you may find that you prefer to use a combination of methods.
